# Machine learning with jupyter notebook (in python)

- Artificial Inteligence (AI) : Enables machine to think

- Machine learning (ML) : subset of AI, provid some statistical tools to explore and analyse the data

  - Supervised machine learning
  
    - Past labeled data
    
  - Insupervised machine learning
  
    - Clustring technics (groupe the data together) based on data similarity
    
      - K-means clustering
      
      - Hierarchical clustering
      
      - DB-Scan clustering
      
  - Reinforcement semi-supervised machine learning

- Deep-Learning (DL) : create multi neural network architecture. Mimic humain brain 

  - ANN : Artificial (input => numbers)
  
  - CNN : Convolutional neural network (input => images, videos...)
  
  - RNN : Recurrent neural network (input => time series)

- Data science : apply all this previous technique using some mathematical tools like statistics, proba, linear algebra ...
